# Cookie AutoDelete

Control your cookies! This extension is inspired by [Self-Destructing Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/). When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Prevent tracking by other cookies and add only the ones you trust. Easily import and export your cookie whitelist.

## Main features

- Automatically deletes cookies from closed tabs
- Whitelist/Greylist support for cookies
- Easily export/import your configurations
- Clear all cookies for a domain
- Supports manual mode cleaning from the popup
- Easily see the number of cookies for a site
- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ only)

### Usage

1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies for to the whitelist (permanently) or greylist (until browser restart)
2. Enable "Automatic Cleaning" in settings or "Auto-Clean" in popup
3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)

#### Requirements

- Latest version of Node.js

#### Development

- `npm install` - Installs all dependencies
- `npm run dev` - This will run the webpack watcher and automatically pack `/src/background.ts`, popup, and setting items and its dependencies to `/extension`
- `npm run lint` - Runs the eslinter for JS files
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite located in `/test`
- `npm run build` - Builds the Firefox (.xpi/.zip) and Chrome (.zip) builds

#### Testing

1. Run `npm install` (if you haven't already)
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Load the extension in the browser

- Firefox

  - Easiest way would be to run the tool [web-ext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext#Testing_out_an_extension)
  - Another way is go into `about:debugging` and load `/extension/manifest.json`

- Chrome
  - In the extension tab, enable Developer Mode, then `load unpacked extension` and load the `/extension` folder

#### Building

1. Run `npm install` (if you haven't already)
2. Run `npm run build`
3. The build files should be in a new folder called `/builds`
