## Internationalization (i18n)

Translate Cookie AutoDelete in your language or help fix a translation!

1. Copy and paste the "/src/_locales/en" folder.
2. Rename the newly copied folder to the language codes found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable)
3. Open the manifest.json in your newly created folder and start translating the "message" JSON properties. The description should be left alone as a reference. Also any word with '$' surrounding it should be left alone as they are placeholders.
4. Test the translation by zipping up the src folder and loading it in your browser. Fix any UI glitches by if possible using a shorter translation.
5. Make a Pull Request and you're done!.
6. Watch for changes in the "/src/_locales/en/messages.json" file for future updates.
